The following classes are classes that we have come up with ourselves:

Interface Rider/Team:
-	Provides a blueprint for classes representing riders and teams in cycling races.
-	Includes methods and properties common to both such as name, nationality, team, etc

Class Riders:
- String name 
- Nationality
- Team 

Class Teams:
- Team name
- Number of riders
- Constructor, Getters and setters

Class Races: 
-Race name
- Racers inherit from teams
- getters and setters for properties
- Methods to manage stage and teams

Class Stage:
-	Stage number/type
-	Stage distance
-	List of checkpoints
-	Constructor, getters and setters


Class Competitions:
-	Competition Type
-	Ranking
-	Constructor, getters, setters

Interface results:
-	Result type
-	More stuff on results

Class Stage:
-	Stage Type 
-	Distance
-	Checkpoints (Checkpoint type is already an enum value)

Abstract Competition Class:
-	To represent a competition within a race (General Classification, Points Classification, or Mountain Classification) â€“ these will be subclasses of competition
-	Provides common properties and methods for different types of competitions
-	Subclasses can specialize for each specific competition type 

RaceResult interface:
-	Allows flexibility of implementing different types of race results, providing a structure for storing and accessing race outcome data.


If there is anything I should add, lmk.
